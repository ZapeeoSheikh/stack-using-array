Topic of Data Structures

Stack is a Linear Data Structure
It works upon LIFO METHOD.
Stack can be static and can be dynamic. 
We can make stack dynamic using linked list, dynamic mean runtime Extendabl.
Similarly we can use static stack using arrays static stack mean we can't extend the size of stack at runtime.


Stack work upon only one pointer called top pointer which is initially start with the index -1 which main stack is empty so whenever we add something into the stack the top pointer will move forward or simply top++
stack Data Structure have only one and open which is top and from the bottom and it is closed that's why it will work upon lifo method last come First serve
Stack have some functions upon which stack work these are listed below

Operation:
Push operation
Pop operation
Peak operation

Some user-defined methods 
Is empty 
Is full
Display



So the push operation is use to add some values the stack
However the pop operation is use to remove/delete the top value placed on stack
Peak operation is use to get The value place on the top of stack without Deleting it


Usage/ Application:
Balancing of Brackets in Programming
Undo method
Recursion
Tower of honoi
Infix to Postfix
